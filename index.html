    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>Train your dog as early as possible. The sooner your dog is trained, the more consistently it will listen to you.
        It is up to you whether you want to try and train the dog yourself, or to hire a professional trainer for
        guidance.
        There are plenty of private trainers that are available to hire online, as well as local pet stores such as
        PetCo and PetSmart.
